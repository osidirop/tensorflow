This is an example on how we can embed DNN that have been already trained by others 
using interception models and add our DNN below that by freezing the already trained DNN.

It is also shown how we can drop out some layers to improve the validation accuracy. 
This helps because neighbor neurons can have similar weights, and thus can skew the final training.
